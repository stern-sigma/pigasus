# Title 

A brief description of what the script is and what it does.

## Getting Started 🔨

Guidance on what initial items need to be set up in order for the script to work properly. For example:

For the pipeline script to work, the following must be set up:
- Create a file called '.env' to store database variables.
- Your .env should have the following format:
  ```
    DB_NAME = XXXXX
  ```


## Dependencies 🛠️

Instructions on how to install dependencies should be written here. For example:

To install dependencies, run the following in your terminal:
  
  ```
  python3 venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- This creates a virtual environment that will allow you to install the required python packages.


## Usage 🫡

- This should include the command to run the script as well as information on any additional arguments that can be used in the script.
